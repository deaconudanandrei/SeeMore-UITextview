# SeeMore-UITextview
Instagram interface with See more button

Done using xCode 7.3 and Swift 2.2

This is just a simple way to add a "See more" button to a textView within a UITableViewCell.
It's based on the Instagram feed with a Header and 3 other UITableViewCells.
  - first cell represents the photo
  - second one for the username and content description (the one with the see more button)
  - and a third cell as a nice buffer between posts
  
You could easily expand this to suport comments with another UITableViewCell
